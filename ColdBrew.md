# Cold Brew

Recipe tried for the Hario Filter-in Coffee Bottle.

Use **55g** coffee of a medium-fine grind for **700ml** of cold water. Darker roasts supposedly work a bit better.

Put both in container. Shake to mix and saturate grounds with water. Let it sit 8 hours in the fridge. Then remove coffee. Keeps a couple days in the fridge.

If you do not have something like the Filter-in Coffee Bottle, the coffee can be removed by filtering it with a normal coffee filter.
