# Aeropress

Use the [inverted method](https://google.com/search?q=aeropress+inverted&tbm=isch) for brewing with the Aeropress for this recipe. The plunger should be in up to the number 4 marking.

Use 1 Aeropress scoop (about 15 grams) of medium/fine-ground coffee. Adjust the grind size to taste as usual.

### Steps

Elapsed Time  |   Action
------|---------
0 s   | Pour in hot water up to top, but so that you can still stir without spilling.
5 s   | Stir until all grounds are wet.
15 s  | Steep.
60 s  | Stir again to mix water and grounds.
65 s  | Flip.
70 s  | Plunge.
90 s  | Finished at 1:30 min.


If the coffee tastes to bitter, let the water cool down a bit before pouring.

### Short Version

The times above are just guidelines. Essentially you want to aim for a steep time of around 45 seconds and plunge for 20 seconds.  One could therefore also simplfy the recipe to the following:

* Up to the **1:00 min** mark: **pour, stir, steep;** then
* up to the **1:30 min** mark: **stir, flip, plunge;** done

Just try to not spent too much time pouring and flipping (~ 5s), then the above is all you need.
