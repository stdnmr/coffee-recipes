# Pour Over

Recipies are in principle for Hario V60, but should work well enough for other pour over options as well.

Use a coffee to water ratio of 60g coffee for 1l of water. Scale according to your desired amount. 

Grind as fine as salt. Adjust the grind to taste as usual and to hit the draw down time.

The basic steps are bloom with a bit of water, than pour the rest of the water and wait for the draw down. The water should be coming right of the boil.

## Steps
1. Start your timer and **pour in a bit of water (2-3x the weight of coffee)**. Fully saturate the beans by **swirling or stiring** your coffee. Wait until the timer hits **30s**.
2. Start to pour in the rest of the water, slow down a bit over time. Aim to **finish the pour at 1:30**. To knock down any coffee particles stuck to the the wall you can **stir** along the wall of the filter. To achieve a flat coffee bed for the draw down, **swirl** the filter around.
3. The **draw down** should end at **around 3 minutes**.
